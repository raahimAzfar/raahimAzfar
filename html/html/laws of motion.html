    <h1><ins>Newton's laws of motion</ins></h1>
<pre>
<p>Sir Issac newton discovered gravity and
made the three laws of motion.His name is used
for the SI unit of force.


<h2 title="law of inertia">Newton's first law of motion</h2>

<p style="font-size:150%;font-family:cursive">An object will remain in motion if in motion
And an object will remain to restive in rest
unless acted on by net force.</p>

<p>basically, if something is moving/still it will
keep going/staying still until a force interacts.</p>


<h2>Newton's second law of motion</h2>

<p style="font-size:150%;font-family:cursive">The acceleration of an object is equal to the
net force on an object divided by mass of
the object.</p>

<p>this is the math equation for that</p>


        <p>acceleration=net force ÷ mass</p>


<h2>Newton's third law of motion</h2>

<p style="font-size:150%;font-family:cursive">Forces act in pairs:For every action
there is an equal but opposite reaction</p>


<p>e.g. when you jump on a trampoline,
the trampoline pushes you back up</p>
