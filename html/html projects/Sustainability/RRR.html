    <h2>Reduce, reuse, recycle</h2>
    <p>We know it may sound corny, but it still stands as true as when it was first created.Everything we buy harms the enviroment in some way, the manufacturing to the to the packaging.Every time you go shopping try to ask yourself if you really need it.If you do need it try to find a version whith cardboard packaging.</p>
